"# Fire-Weather-Prediction" 
-This project aims to predict fire weather conditions using Machine Learning models. By leveraging weather data and other relevant environmental features, we can assess fire weather risks, aiding in early warnings and mitigation efforts.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and feature engineering from raw weather datasets.
- **FWI Calculation**: Predicting the Fire Weather Index using meteorological features.
- **ML Models**: Training regression  models to predict fire risk levels.
- **Visualizations**: Insights into weather trends and model predictions.
